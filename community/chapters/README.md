# Chapters

An Open Source Community Africa chapter is a community closer to home. It typically consists of a group of people coming together to organize and facilitate meetups, creating an environment of support in possible areas of challenge while following the OSCA Code of Conduct.

Our goal is to increase the rate of credible contributions by African software developers, designers, writers, and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open source projects both locally and globally, changing Africans' perception from just the billion users to the NEXT BILLION CREATORS.

An OSCA chapter lead represents a global network of open-source enthusiasts and is responsible for growing and supporting vibrant local OSCA communities in Africa.
